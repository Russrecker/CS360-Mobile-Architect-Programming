### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was a weight tracker that let users log their weight and set a goal. It was made to help people stay on track with their health by tracking progress and getting alerts when they hit their goal. The main user need was to have a simple way to record their weight and view their progress.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app had two main screens. The weight entry screen and setttings screen. The weight entry screen was where you log the weight, and the settings screen was where you enter the goal weight, phone number, and a switch to turn on notifications. The UI was very simple and just showed the bare minimum of what was needed and I made sure everything was easy to understand and quick to use.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I first started by creating the UI of the app and then the functionality afterwards. I basically broke down everything into small parts. I reused code when I could and made sure each part worked before moving on. I would definitely use that same step-by-step approach again in future projects.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested by trying out everything in the app like adding, editing, and deleting the weight entries. I also tested to see if the goal weight would work and a notification would pop up when reached and a SMS message sent. Testing like this is important because it can catch small issues early and shows if something isn’t working the way it should.

### Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One of the main challenges I had was getting the buttons to show up with the right color. For some reason even though I made them blue in the code, they were showing up as purple and didn’t match the rest of the app, so I had to adjust the style and themes to fix that. Another issue I faced was the status bar on top being hidden since I was using a white background and they were also white. I figured out a way to make them black to be visible. I also had issues with the SMS notification switch. When users denied the permission, they were still able to turn the notification switch on so I had to find a way to stop that from happening. 

### In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
What I think I did best was designing the UI and layout of the app. I kept the screens clean and simple, and made sure everything was easy to read and use. The settings screen, dialogs, and list all looked polished, and it felt like something a real user could actually use.
